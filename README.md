1. This article interests me because it discusses humanities students entering the STEM field which connects to the career path I want to pursue in the future.

2. I have been able to create simple data visualizations in previous DH courses but I hope to make more advanced and creative data visualizations in this course using Python. 

# Ideas for Data to Investigate
* History
* Mythology 
* Language 

Web scraping and APIs is the concept from the syllabus that appeals most to me because I have the least knowledge about this topic compared to others on the syllabus.

# Introduction

## Data Description
Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/makeup-shades-dataset

I chose create my project based on the Makeup Shade Dataset. This 2018 dataset is based on US, Nigeria, India, and Japan's most popular makeup brands, their bestselling foundations, and their shade range. 

## Motivation
My motivation for choosing this data set and topic comes from my own personal interest in beauty and makeup. Outside of class, I am part of the club 'Aurum', a beauty/skincare club on campus. In addition, the topic of foundation shades is personal to me as I had difficulty finding the correct skintone of foundation for my skintone as a POC. Furthermore, being Asian-American, I often struggle with balancing both Asian and Western beauty standards. While Asian beauty standards focus on paleness, Western beauty standards idealizes tan skin. In addition, as beauty products become more globalized, I have noticed that makeup brands have started focusing on inclustivity and pigmentation of all their products to cater towards a wide demographic. I am interested to see how these standards can be seen through this dataset. I plan to analyze U.S foundation collection shades versus Japanese, Indian, and Nigerian foundational collection shades. I would like to note that even though Nigeria is not in Asia, many countries with POC also tend to idealized paler skin. 

## Research Questions
• How does best-selling brands and their foundation shade range in Western countries and Eastern countries compare?  What do the results reveal about their respective beauty industries and societal beauty standards?

• How do the founders of beauty companies play a role in the inclusitivity of their makeup shades?
